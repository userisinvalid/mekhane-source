# Mekhane

This is the (almost) full source code of the Mekhane bot in JavaScript, to help people learn to make some functions in this bot. Comments aren't fully detailed yet, I might fix this in the future.

## Disclaimer

I know it's unoptimized, I'm too scared to move around old code that I made several months ago and have no memory of making it or how it's supposed to work. If you want to help, I'd be more than happy to hear it

## Dependencies
```
npm install discord.js
npm install request
```

## Important
Rename ``sample-config.json`` to ``config.json`` and alter the values to your liking.
